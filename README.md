## App Brainstorming (Step 4):

Additional Color Options: Although the app currently generates a completely random color, we could add options for users to specify the range of colors or pick from a palette of predefined colors.

Color Schemes: Users could have the option to apply different color schemes or gradients instead of a single color.

Save and Load Colors: Implement a feature that allows users to save their favorite colors or load previously used colors.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.


Diving into Swift and iOS app development for the first time was both challenging and exciting. Navigating new tools like Xcode and the nuances of Swift syntax presented a steep learning curve. Despite the initial difficulties, building the Coloring app has been a rewarding experience, providing a solid foundation for my future in iOS development.
